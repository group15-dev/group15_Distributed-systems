Assignment Title: Building a Simple Distributed Chat Application 
Objective: 
The aim of this assignment is to help students understand the principles of distributed computing 
by creating a simple chat application that operates over a network of multiple server nodes and 
clients. Students will learn about client-server communication, message broadcasting, and basic 
fault tolerance.  
Assignment Description: 
You are required to develop a simple distributed chat application that allows multiple clients to 
send and receive messages in real-time. The system should include at least two server nodes that 
can manage client connections and relay messages between clients.  
Methodology to Achieve the Assignment: 
Step 1: Design the System Architecture 
 Define Components: Identify the components of the system, which will include:  
o Client: The application that users will interact with. 
o Server: The backend that handles communication between clients. 
 Communication Protocol: Decide on a protocol for communication (e.g., TCP sockets). 
Step 2: Set Up the Development Environment 
 Choose a Programming Language: Select a programming language for implementation 
(e.g., Python, Java, or Node.js). 
 Install Necessary Libraries: Ensure you have the necessary libraries for socket 
programming and any other required dependencies. 
Step 3: Implement the Server 
1 
 Create Server Nodes: Write code to handle multiple server nodes.  
o Each server should be capable of accepting client connections. 
o Implement functionality to broadcast messages received from one client to all 
other connected clients. 
 Manage Client Connections: Use threading or asynchronous programming to manage 
multiple clients simultaneously. 
Step 4: Implement the Client 
 Create the Client Interface: Develop a simple command-line or graphical user interface 
(GUI) for the client. 
 Connect to Server: Implement functionality for the client to connect to the server and 
send messages. 
 Receive Messages: Ensure the client can listen for and display messages from other 
clients. 
Step 5: Implement Basic Fault Tolerance 
 Server Failover: Implement a basic mechanism to handle server failures. For example:  
o If one server goes down, clients should be able to reconnect to another server. 
 Message Persistence: Optionally, you can implement a simple log to persist messages in 
case of server crashes. 
Step 6: Testing the System 
 Test Functionality: Ensure all functionalities work as expected:  
o Multiple clients can connect. 
o Messages are broadcasted correctly. 
o System can handle server failures. 
 Simulate Load: Test how the system performs under load by connecting multiple clients 
and sending messages simultaneously. 
Step 7: Documentation 
 Code Documentation: Ensure that the code is well-commented and easy to understand. 
 User Guide: Create a README file that includes:  
o Instructions to set up and run the application. 
o Explanation of how to use the chat application. 
 Report: Write a report (2-3 pages) covering:  
o The architecture of your chat application. 
o Challenges faced during implementation and solutions implemented. 
o Performance evaluation and potential improvements. 
Deliverables: 
2 
1. Screenshot the User/Front Interface (UI) of the App and make it as front page of the 
presentation document after the group names 
2. Source Code: Submit the complete source code of your chat application, organized in a 
clear directory structure. 
3. Documentation: Include a comprehensive README file and a user guide. 
4. Report: Submit a brief report discussing the architecture, challenges, and performance 
evaluation. 
Evaluation Criteria: 
 Functionality: Does the chat application meet all the specified requirements? 
 Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and documented? 
 Documentation Quality: Is the README and report clear and informative? 
 Creativity: Are there any additional features implemented that enhance the application 
(e.g., private messaging, user authentication)? 
Submission Guidelines: 
 Submit your assignment via Submission email: studentassignment690@gmail.com & 
Submission: 10th /Oct/2025 
 Ensure that all files are properly named and organized. 
This assignment will provide you with practical experience in distributed systems and enhance 
your understanding of real-world applications in networked environments.
