- **Submission Email:** `studentassignment690@gmail.com`  

## Assignment Title  
**Building a Simple Distributed Chat Application**  

## Objective  
The aim of this assignment is to help students understand the principles of **distributed computing** by creating a **simple chat application** that operates over a network of multiple server nodes and clients.  

You will learn about:  
- Client-server communication  
- Message broadcasting  
- Basic fault tolerance  


## Assignment Description  
Develop a distributed chat application that allows multiple clients to send and receive messages in real time.  

The system should:  
- Include at least **two server nodes** to manage client connections.  
- Relay messages between connected clients.  

## Methodology  

### Step 1: Design the System Architecture  
- **Define Components**  
  - **Client:** Application users interact with  
  - **Server:** Backend handling communication between clients  
- **Communication Protocol:** Choose a protocol (e.g., TCP sockets)  

### Step 2: Set Up the Development Environment  
- Select a programming language (e.g., Python, Java, Node.js)  
- Install required libraries for socket programming and dependencies  

### Step 3: Implement the Server  
- Create multiple server nodes:  
  - Accept client connections  
  - Broadcast messages to all clients  
- Manage multiple clients using threading or asynchronous programming  

### Step 4: Implement the Client  
- Develop a command-line or GUI interface  
- Connect client to server for sending messages  
- Receive and display messages from other clients  

### Step 5: Implement Basic Fault Tolerance  
- **Server Failover:** Clients reconnect to another server if one fails  
- **Message Persistence (Optional):** Implement logging for message recovery  

### Step 6: Testing the System  
- Verify functionalities:  
  - Multiple clients can connect  
  - Messages broadcast correctly  
  - System handles server failures  
- Simulate load with multiple simultaneous connections  

### Step 7: Documentation  
- Comment code clearly  
- Create a **README** with setup and usage instructions  
- Write a **2–3 page report** covering:  
  - System architecture  
  - Challenges and solutions  
  - Performance evaluation and improvements  

## Deliverables  
1. **User Interface Screenshot** – As the front page of the presentation (after group names)  
2. **Source Code** – Organized in a clear directory structure  
3. **Documentation** – Comprehensive README and user guide  
4. **Report** – Architecture, challenges, performance evaluation  


## Evaluation Criteria  
- **Functionality:** Meets requirements  
- **Code Quality:** Well-structured, readable, documented  
- **Documentation Quality:** Clear and informative README + report  
- **Creativity:** Extra features (e.g., private messaging, authentication)  

## Submission Guidelines  
- Submit via email: `studentassignment690@gmail.com`  
- Deadline: **10th October 2025**  
- Ensure files are **properly named and organized**  

## Learning Outcome  
This assignment gives you **hands-on experience** in distributed systems and strengthens your understanding of **real-world networked applications**.
